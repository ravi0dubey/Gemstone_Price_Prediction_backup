MLOPS project

## Step1 : Setting up the environment by following either of the process

### Option 1: Running init_setup.sh

```
If linux has conda in it then run below command 
1. bash init_setup.sh

In windows system we need to install unbuntu by running command  
2. wsl --install -d Ubuntu
3. Enter userid and password for linux

Then Install conda following below steps
4. wget https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh
5. bash Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh
6. source ~/.bashrc
7. bash init_setup.sh
```

### Option 2: Running installation command manually
```
1. conda create  --prefix ./gemstone_env python=3.11.4 -y **OR** python -m venv gemstone_env
2. conda activate "D:\Study\Data Science\MLOPS\Gemstone_Price_Prediction\gemstone_env"   **OR** gemstone_env\Scripts\activate
3. pip install -r requirements_dev.txt
4. pip install dvc
5. dvc init
6. pip install dvc-s3
```

## Step2 : Data Version Control and storing the dataset version in AWS S3 bucket and storing the dataset version in AWS S3 bucket
Run below commands to do version control of gemstone.csv file
```
1. dvc remote add -d remote/storage url s3://gemstone-dataset
2. dvc add dataset/gemstone.csv
3. git add .
4.  git commit -m "started tracking gemstone.csv under dvc" it will create new log with commit id 9181213
5.  git push origin main
6.  dvc push -> it will push the dataset  and its version to S3 bucket
7. make changes to gemstone.csv file by removing 10 records from bottom
8. git add .
9. git commit -m "dremoved 10 records from bottomm" it will create new log with commit id f7d5730
10. git checkout it checkout 9181213 -> if we want to restore to original form of gemstone.csv and want 10 records back
11. dvc checkout -> it will restore the dataset to its original form
```

```
12. make changes to gemstone.csv file by adding 2 records at the bottom and run command **dvc status** you will see file has been changed
```

```
13. dvc add dataset/gemstone.csv
14. git add .
15. git commit -m "added 2 records in gemstone.csv under dvc" it will create new log 
16.  git push origin main
17.  dvc push -> it will push the dataset  and its version to S3 bucket
```

## Step3 : Data Version Control for Pipeline
Run below commands to do version control of gemstone.csv file
```
1. add airflow/training_pipeline.py
2. add dvc.yaml which has all the stages
3. dvc repro
4. dvc show
```

## Step 4 : Run Training Pipeline manually
To train the model follow below steps
```
1. mlflow server --host 127.0.0.1 --port 7070(It needs to be executed in one terminal and it should keep on running)
2. python .\source\pipeline\training_pipeline.py (run it in separate terminal)
```

On running the **Training Pipeline** you will get below output and the url to see the Experiments results in MLFLOW. Click on the url http://127.0.0.1:7070/#/experiments/0/runs/9b8d411fd2104a91903594a227cf70ff to see the experiments output

## Step 5 : Prediction
To see the prediction of prices following below steps
```
1. python .\app.py
2. run http://localhost:8012/ to see the main screen
3. copy http://localhost:8012/predict to new window
4. Enter the different input values and then press Submit button
5. You should see predicted price of stone.
